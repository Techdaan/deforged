# Deforged
A sidemod for Pixelmon Reforged to patch annoyances and bugs, to improve the quality of life using the mod. 

**Note:** Licensed under the GPLv3 license.

# Changes made by the Deforged project
- Removes polluting the client's multiplayer server list without consent. Reason being is that players should decide which servers are on their server list - not Pixelmon. Players never consented to a server list being downloaded, and it's very time consuming to clear out the list.
- Fixes nicknames not rendering properly in the GUI (Text formatting is not applied anywhere).
