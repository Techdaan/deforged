/**
 * Fixes Pixelmon NPCs not downloading player skins due to an oversight in updating between Minecraft 1.16.5 and 1.20.2.
 * <p>
 * In 1.16.5 the {@link TextureManager#getTexture(ResourceLocation)} method would return null if the texture did not
 *  exist, but in 1.20.2, the method returns a default/new texture instead.
 * <p>
 * The fix redirects the method to {@link TextureManager#getTexture(ResourceLocation, AbstractTexture)} instead, with
 *  a second argument of null. This method returns a {@link java.util.Map#getOrDefault(Object, Object)} call using the
 *  provided resource location and texture, returning null if the texture does not exist, which is the intended
 *  behaviour of the {@link NPCChatting#getTexture()} method.
